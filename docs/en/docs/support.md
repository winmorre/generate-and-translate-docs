## Hooks

> **NEW** in version 0.1.1

Hooks are useful when you need to conditionally load data that depends on the
previously loaded settings.

Before getting into hooks, lets understand why they are useful.

## Django Debug settings

```py
DEBUG = True
```

The above settings will run the application in debug mode

## Bash support

```bash
LOADED_DEBUG=false
```
